# FloV3R - DiY 6DoF VR Headset

FloV3R is an DiY, affordable, and a super fun to build project made for tinkeres.
It is built so that you can play any SteamVR game! It features 6DoF tracking on both the headset and controllers, which themself have a build in transcievers and LiPo batteries which make them wireless.

The whole build should be around $100 (with 2K display), but it might be more expensive depending on where you order the parts from. (It might be cheaper too :p)

## Printed Circuit Boards
I designed the schematics and PCB's using KiCad 7.0.9. They are made and designed by me, but I took inspiration from [HadesVR](https://github.com/HadesVR/HadesVR).
Circuit boards use some SMD components. I went this route because they are just more suitable for the purpose of something that you hold/wear.
If you are not feeling like soldering them by yourself, you can always buy pre-assembled PCB's.
Just keep in mind that this is also a good opportunity to learn how to solder them :)
