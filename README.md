# FloV3R - DiY 6DoF VR Headset
[This project is currently in developement]

FloV3R is an DiY, affordable, and a super fun to build project made for tinkeres.
It is built so that you can play any SteamVR game! It features 6DoF tracking on both the headset and controllers, which themself have a build in transcievers and LiPo batteries which make them wireless.

The whole build should be around $100 (with 2K display), but it might be more expensive depending on where you order the parts from. (It might be cheaper too :p)

## Printed Circuit Boards

I designed the schematics and PCB's using KiCad 7.0.9. They are designed by me, but I took inspiration from [HadesVR](https://github.com/HadesVR/HadesVR).
Circuit boards have some SMD components. I went this route because they are just more suitable for the purpose of something that you hold/wear.
If you are not feeling like soldering them by yourself, you can always buy pre-assembled PCB's.
Just keep in mind that this is also a good opportunity to learn how to solder them :)

PCB's for both the mainboard and controllers are designed for homemade fabrication.
They are pretty challenging to make due to them being double sided. If you want to try making them on your own, use some high precision method such as the one with photo resist film.
I recommend applying soldermask to the board. For doing vias you can electroplate them or use a wire from RJ45 cable so that you insert them into the via and solder it.

### FloV3R R1 Mainboard:
The mainboard of the headset is an dual layer PCB. It is the easier one to assamble :p

## Displays

This headset is compatible with pretty much any screen, although I recommend following this guide from [HadesVR - Choosing the display](https://github.com/HadesVR/HadesVR/blob/main/docs/Headset.md#displays).

I went with "LS055R1SX04 with Green board", due to pretty good resolution (2K) and good price.
