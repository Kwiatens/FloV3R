### Building FloV3R - Part 1 - About the project

FloV3R VR is an open source VR headset and controllers made for tinkerers and hackers. 
With it you can play almost any SteamVR game and have lot's of fun :)
It features 6DoF tracking on both the headset and controllers, which themself have a build in transcievers and LiPo batteries which make them wireless.

The whole build should be a bit over $140 (including controllers), but it might be more expensive depending on where you order the parts from. (It might be cheaper too :p)
