*Please DO NOT buy an Arduino Pro Micro with an micro USB connector, buy the USB-C one! (The micro USB ones have a suuuper weak solder joint with the connector and it can just break off - learned that the hard way...)

**Neopixel with wires (this is how it should look like):

For the FloV3R set to work you will need some long cables and at least two PS Eye cameras.
We will talk about it a bit later so don't worry ;)
